testName: Functionality Over Time
criterias:
  - criteriaName: >-
      The company will continue to maintain the intended functionality of the
      product over the product's expected life cycle.
    indicators:
      - indicator: >-
          Every feature of the product will continue to work for as long as I
          can reasonably expect; that is, the manufacturer will not 'brick'
          certain parts of the product during that time frame.


          The manufacturer will not cease to support the functionality I come to
          expect.


          Replacement services will exist if the manufacturer ceases to support
          the functionality.
