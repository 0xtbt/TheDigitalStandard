Test Name:
Product stability

Criteria:
The software is reliable.

Indicators:
The software is not susceptible to crashes.
If there are crashes, they reflect good programming behaviors.
The software is not vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks.

Procedure Overview:
Fuzz software to see if and how it crashes. 
 How many crashes did American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) produce in the course of testing?
 Are crashes exploitable, or do they simply allow a disruption of service?
Perform modified fuzzing to determine the software's vulnerability to algorithmic complexity attacks.

Readiness Flag:
