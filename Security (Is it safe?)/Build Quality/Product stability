Test Name:
Product stability

Criteria:
The software is reliable.

  Indicator:
  The software is not susceptible to crashes.

  If the program is forced to unexpectedly terminate, it shuts down in a safe and responsible fashion.

    Procedure Overview:
    Fuzz software to see if and how it crashes. 
    Under appropriate fuzz testing, what was the code coverage, number of crashes, and type(s) of crashes.
    Are crashes exploitable, or do they simply allow a disruption of service?

  Indicator:
  The software is not vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks.

    Procedure Overview:
    Perform modified fuzzing to determine the software's vulnerability to algorithmic complexity attacks.

Readiness Flag:
