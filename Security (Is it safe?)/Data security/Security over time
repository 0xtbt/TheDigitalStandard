Procedure Overview:
Examine software settings and product documentation to determine if automatic software updates are enabled by default or can be enabled by the user.
If updates are not automatic, examine software settings and product documentation to determine if the product notifies the user if a software update is available, and if that notification is persistent, or if the user can easily determine if a software update is available.
Execute the procedure to install a software update and evaluate the ease of installation by comparing against established references.
Check if a later version of software exists but the product cannot be updated to it (e.g. Android devices with pre-KitKat versions).
